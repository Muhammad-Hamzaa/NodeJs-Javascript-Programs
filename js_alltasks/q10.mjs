// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// let name1 = 'Hamza';
// name1 = name1.toLowerCase()

const sentence = "In the above comments, i've store my name in name1 variable and convert it into a lowercase";
